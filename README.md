## How to use it

For my purposes, I use this word/password list as a replacement for the much smaller password lists distributed with Kali Linux.


Once you clone this repo you should merge all the text files into one large wordlist text file.



**Linux**

`cat password_list_part_01.txt password_list_part_02.txt > full_wordlist.txt`



**Windows**

`copy /b password_list_part_01.txt+password_list_part_02.txt full_wordlist.txt`
